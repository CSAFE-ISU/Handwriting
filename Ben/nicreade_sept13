Quick summary of how to run preprocess.py
for performance / testing reasons i used an interpreter called pypy. learning numpy to reduce need for interpreter dependency. 

installing the pypy binary and adding it to your systems $PATH will make it visible for preprocess to get a welcome performance boost, i'll change this for sure in the future.

switch to my branch
library("reticulate")
cwd to handwriter/R/
source_python("preprocess.py")
test <- preprocess(someSampleProcessedAndCropped)
test will now be a list with row(y) and col(x) indexes marked, along with another column called "type".

I followed your email and converted the resultant list into a vector.
