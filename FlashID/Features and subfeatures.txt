Description of exported measurements data. 

The exported data is organized into one CSV file for each isomorphism/shapecode pair. There is a separate line in each file 
for each instance of a grapheme of that class. Each line contains the following columns:

IdentityKey - Unique Id of the writer.
IdentityName - Name of the writer.
Isomorphism - Isomorphism code for the grapheme.
ShapeCode - Shapecode for the graphmeme.
Measurement Data - One or more columns for each measurement type for this grapheme type. Not all measurement types are created for each
grapheme type. The names of the columns are encoded as follows:

_<FeatureNumber>_<SubfeatureNumber>_<Count> or _<FeatureNumber>_<SubfeatureNumber>_Offset_<Count> The text "Offset" indicates that the
value is an X-Y offset rather than a measurement in pixels or angular degrees. The definitions of the Feature Numbers and Subfeature Numbers
are documented below. The Count value is an incremental counter for the number of measurements of that measurement type. For example, the
columns: 	_2001_2_1,_2001_2_2,_2001_2_3,_2001_2_4,_2001_2_5,_2001_2_6 represent 6 measurements of absolute distance from vertex to vertex 
of a 4 vertex graph (distances from 1->2, 1->3, 1->4, 2->3. 2->4, 3->4). The number of columns for a specific measurement is based on the 
feature and subfeature type and number of vertices and/or edges in the graph.
